# House Price Prediction Web Application
This repository contains a Flask-based web application for predicting house prices. The application allows users to input various features of a house, and based on those features, it predicts the house price using a machine learning model. The application includes two pages: one for predicting house prices in Bangalore, India, and another for predicting house prices in the USA.

## Overview
The application predicts house prices based on input features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size in square feet, and location. It uses a machine learning model trained on open-source datasets for Bangalore and the USA. The application is divided into two pages:

- **Bangalore House Price Prediction:** Uses features like bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and location to predict house prices in Bangalore.
- **USA House Price Prediction:** Uses additional features like living area, lot area, floors, and more to predict house prices in the USA.

## Model Implementation

The models used for prediction were implemented as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Datasets were cleaned and features selected.
   - Data was split into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - **Bangalore House Price Prediction:**
     - Implemented using XGBRegressor with `xgboost` library.
     -  Saved model and label encoder:  `label_enocoder.pkl` `house_price_model.pkl`.
       
   - **USA House Price Prediction:** 
     -  Implemented using XGBRegressor with `xgboost` library.
     -  Saved model and label encoder:  `Usa_label1.pkl` `Usa_price1.pkl`.
     


4. **Model Saving:**
   - Models were saved using `pickle`.

5. **Integration with Flask Application:**
   - Saved models are loaded in the Flask application.
   - Predictions are made based on user inputs and displayed in the app.
